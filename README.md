•	Detected Multicollinearity of predictors by VIF and selected the most significant predictors by Lasso Regularization

•	Implemented various Classification methods like Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGBoost

•	Compared the model performances on the basis of measures such as Sensitivity, Specificity and AUC-ROC

•	Achieved the best model using Logistic Regression and improved the sensitivity of the model from 4% to 92% using SMOTE on the imbalanced dataset and selection of optimum decision threshold of 0.48 in Logistic Regression setting
